# DEPRECATED

This library has been deprecated as part of a purescript-contrib cleanup -- see [the full discussion on Discourse](https://discourse.purescript.org/t/proposed-purescript-contrib-library-deprecations) for more details.

This library has been deprecated because the underlying React functionality has since been replaced by [react-transition-group](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group) -- see the notice on the [addons-css-transition-group npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-addons-css-transition-group) for details. Authors writing React applications today would be better served using the new package via a foreign import instead of this library.

Previous releases are still available.
